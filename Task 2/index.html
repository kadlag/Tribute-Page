                    <b>Shivaji Bhonsale I (Marathi pronunciation: [ʃiʋaˑd͡ʒiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c.19 February 1630 – 3 April
                        1680), also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of
                        the Bhonsle Maratha clan. He initially served as the Jagirdar of Pune after 1664 succeeding his
                        father Shahaji. Eventually, Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining
                        Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was
                        formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.

                        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal
                        Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.
                        Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building
                        forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule
                        with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political
                        traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages,
                        replacing Persian in court and administration.

                        Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he
                        began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as
                        many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.

                <h3 >Early Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is
                    now in Pune
                    district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as
                    a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a
                    local deity, the goddess Shivai. Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who
                    served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of
                    Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.

                    Shivaji belonged to Maratha family of Bhonsle clan. His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552-1597)
                    was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was
                    given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given
                    Fort Shivneri for his family's residence (c.1590).

                    At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur,
                    Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar,
                    the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small
                    army.

                        <h4>It was the first fort captured by Shivaji as Chieftain of Marathas which led to the
                            foundation

                            his ruling attributes of valour and determination at the age of 16. This conquest drives him
                            to
                            capture another like Raigarh and Pratapgarh. Due to these conquests, the Sultan of Bijapur
                            was
                            getting panic and he put Shahji, Shivaji's father in prison. In AD 1659, Shivaji again tried
                            to
                            attack Bijapur then the Sultan of Bijapur sent his general, Afzal Khan, to capture Shivaji.
                            But
                            Shivaji managed to escape and killed him with a deadly weapon called Baghnakh or the tiger's
                            claw. Finally, in 1662, the Sultan of Bijapur made a peace treaty with Shivaji and made him
                            an
                            independent ruler of his conquered territories.

                            crowned as Chhatrapati at Raigarh. His coronation symbolises the rise of people who
                            challenges the legacy of the Mughal’s. After the coronation, he gets the title of ‘Haidava
                            Dharmodharka’ (Protector of Hindu faith) of the newly formed state of Hindavi Swarajya. This
                            coronation gives a legitimate right to collect land revenue and levy tax on the people.
